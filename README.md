Prediction of flight delays is essential for a passenger who has to reach his/her destination on time, predicting and reducing the delay is important for business and airline as well. What can not be measured can not be managed. Accurate prediction of flight delays can enhance operational efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and facilitate better resource planning. Towards this we want to explore right prediction models for delay of flights in minutes between cities based on the available historical data. We will be exploring conventional ML algorithms like Random Forest, Decision trees, XG Boost in addition we will also use deep neural network to predict the same. We will provide comparative statistics like MAE(mean absolute error), MSE(mean squared error), accuracy, F1 score, R2 score. We will also be providing representational use case which will help the user select the right airline based on delay and the airlines to predict delays and plan the staffing and ground operations better.
